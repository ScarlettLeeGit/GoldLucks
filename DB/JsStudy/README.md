#JsStudy

This is a project for studying webSQL.
What I want is making small MEMO web app that is consists of just two pages: main, new_memo

8/31
I copied and pasted 
1. 2 html paragraphs that are main & new_memo in index.html
2. everything in css/style.css
3. parts of database.js
4. parts of app.js
5. none of getcontent.js

the problem is:
When I executed it, I can't move from main to new_memo and the button is wierd. What button I expect in main is "new memo" but there is "OK" that must be in new_memo page.
